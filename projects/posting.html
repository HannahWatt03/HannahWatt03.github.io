        <p>This project was conducted in my third year of university as part of the Web Development course. 
          The goal of this project was to create a posting page that allows users to create, edit, and search for posts.
          This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was a solo project, meaning I was responsible for all aspects of the project.
          This included not only front-end development, but also back-end development using CouchDB and Docker. 
          This video was used to submit the project and walks through the functionality of the posting page.
