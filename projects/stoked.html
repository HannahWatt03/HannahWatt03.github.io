        <p>This project was developed in my third year of university as a part of my 
          Computer Engineerng course. For this project, we were prompted to reach out to 
          any business of our choosing, and create a software for them. Our business of choice was
          Stoked by Splitsville (Formally known as The Stoked Center at the time this project occured). 
          This was also a group project. I was repsponsible for UI of landing pages, creating a veiwable photo libary,
          creating an email emulation, and account points tracking. This video was filmed for submission of the project, and walks through how to download it from our gitlab page.
